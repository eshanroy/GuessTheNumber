# GuessTheNumber

A simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 5 attempts.

# How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number from 1 to 100.
- The player has 5 chances to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, a hint is given:
  - Too Low
  - Too High
- If the correct number is guessed, the game ends with a success message.
- If all attempts are used, the correct number is revealed.

# Skills Used

- Python basics
- `random` module
- Loops (`for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Input handling (`input()`, `int()`)
- Error handling (`try-except`)
